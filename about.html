        <p>Our love story began in 2015, in the cold northern land of Syracuse University. It was at a lively Greek life party where our paths first crossed. The connection was instant, and from that moment, a beautiful love story began to unfold.</p>
        <p>Over the years, our bond has only grown stronger. We've shared countless memories, from late-night study sessions to exciting adventures around the world. Through it all, our love for each other has been our guiding light.</p>
        <p>Now, we're excited to embark on our greatest adventure yet: marriage. We can't wait to celebrate this special moment with all of you in the beautiful paradise of Brazil.</p>
