            <h2>What is the dress code?</h2>
            <p>Friday May 23rd 2025: Family & friends will kick off the wedding weekend by wearing all white. White is symbolic for peace and harmony.</p>
            <p>Saturday day of wedding: Our ceremony will be outdoors on a grass field at "Espaço Altar da Fazenda Verde” so we suggest guests choose comfortable shoes without losing the elegance that this day deserves. Dress code: garden semi formal.</p>
